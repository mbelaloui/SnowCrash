looking in the pcap file withe the commande

tcpdump -r level02.pcap -X -A

we can deduce that this is an interception of network traffic by the presence of loging and password.

by reading the data part of the packets after the one who has password in his data part

we can read this :

66 74 5f 77 61 6e 64 72 7f 7f 7f 4e 44 52 65 6c 7f 4c 30 4c 

echo  66 74 5f 77 61 6e 64 72 7f 7f 7f 4e 44 52 65 6c 7f 4c 30 4c | xxd -r -p
