revesing engineer the binary levl08

level08@SnowCrash:~$ strings level08 
printf

strstr :	we supose that in the source code the program will try to compare a string with another

	read
	open
	__libc_start_main
	write
	%s [file to read]

token		may be this is the str compared with
You may not access '%s' : error code that is printed if the comparaison is not or is ok


Unable to open %s : 
Unable to read fd %d:
error if the file is not opend and the programe can not get an fd to read the file

we can supose that the binary will try to read a file do some comparaison and if the comparaision is ok/not ok show's the contenant of the file or wxite the programe


ls -la 

>level08@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la
-rwsr-s---+ 1 flag08  level08 8617 Mar  5  2016 level08
-rw-------  1 flag08  flag08    26 Mar  5  2016 token

We have a binary file and a file named level08 and token 
the binary file is bellong to flag08 user and level08 group
the token file bellong to the flag08

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 /tmp/t
test

./level08 token 
You may not access 'token'

So we can supose that the binary file try to read file and print the contenant but if the name of the file is token the binary print an error message 


we can try to "contourner" la contrainte " that don't let us to read the file flag
with creating a link to this file in the tmp dir

 
level08@SnowCrash:~$ ln -s ~/token /tmp/bingo ; ./level08 /tmp/bingo
